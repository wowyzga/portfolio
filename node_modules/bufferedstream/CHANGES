= 1.6.0 / 2013-03-18

  * Use node 0.10's setImmediate instead of process.nextTick (thanks @jeffbski).

= 1.5.1 / 2013-03-09

  * Don't emit "end" when paused (thanks @utricularian).

= 1.5.0 / 2013-02-19

  * Don't emit non-standard "pause" and "resume" events.
  * Ignore flushes after ending.

= 1.4.1 / 2012-11-29

  * Emit "end" even if the stream is empty after being resumed in a future tick.

= 1.4.0 / 2012-11-29

  * The "end" event isn't emitted until the next tick, even on empty streams.

= 1.3.0 / 2012-10-17

  * Removed BufferedStream#flush to be more consistent with native node streams.
  * More tests.

= 1.2.0 / 2012-10-16

  * Fixed a bug that caused end to be emitted multiple times when using pause
    & resume functionality.
  * Calling pause/resume consecutively only emits an event if the stream is
    currently in the opposite state.
  * Make paused part of the public interface.
  * Make the buffer of a destroyed stream null to save on memory.
  * Removed BufferedStream#destroy.

= 1.1.0 / 2012-10-08

  * Don't prevent the process from exiting when data is still left in the
    stream. This is a responsibility of the stream consumer, not the stream
    itself (thanks @jeffbski).

= 1.0.2 / 2012-10-07

  * Use setInterval instead of process.nextTick to prevent pegging the CPU
    when streams are paused (thanks @jeffbski).
  * Use Infinity instead of -1 to indicate that a stream has no maximum size
    (thanks @mscdex).
  * Use mocha for testing.
